# carGame

Endless Runner Game.

Goal: To collect 20 coins (can be modified but for now it is hard coded)

The game is intended to use in Android devices, and the car movement is controlled by accelerometer. Tapping disabled for this demo.

There are 5 different "chunks" of map that will be spawning endlessly until you get the goal.


Project made in Unity using Tutorials as base, adding different 3D models and more canvas to make it more interactive.
